Nodeman - Nodemanager for the WMN
Go with the flow!

Right now, from what can be observed, These are the scripts that are being used : 

node.click -> Runs on a node and handles all the activites of that node. Also listens for any upcoming broadcasts from the gates to update the gate table 
accordingly. It also decides which gate to route the outbound traffic to using our QoS processing , which just does it on an even - odd source port basis for 
now.

bridge.click - Runs on a gate which is bridged to an external gateway and routes the traffic to external worlds for the internal network. If any NAT is 
required, this seems like a place to do it. 

mac-ping.click - Modified now to change what it was originally intended to do. It broadcasts L2 packets and usually is meant to run on the gate. The gate's IP
address is embedded in the packet. Any additional metrics that are required to be sent can be just appended to the end of the generated	packet. 


Other than this, some developer notes regarding the scripts : 

#) Regarding the fluid gates and dynamic addition : 
	One element which serves as the container for gates and the MAC-IP Binding.
	One element which when supplied the mac-ip-broadcasts using mac-ping.click builds up the table.
	One element which reads the gateway table and selects a gate on the basis of QoS and source port.
