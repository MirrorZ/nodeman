AN SDN APPROACH FOR EFFICIENT INTERNET BANDWIDTH UTILIZATION IN WIRELESS MESH NETWORKS


ABSTRACT
Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) have been emerging in the last couple of years as a cost effective alternative to traditional wired access networks. A typical WMN combines a fixed network (backbone) and a mobile network (backhaul). The nodes in a WMN often act as relays, forwarding traffic to or from other mesh nodes, or providing localized connectivity to mobile or pervasive wireless devices, such as 
laptops, desktops and other mobile clients. Some of these nodes, called mesh gates, are directly connected to the Internet and provide Internet access to all other mesh nodes. IEEE 802.11s is the IEEE standard for Wireless Mesh Networks and is present in the Linux kernel in the form of open80211s (o11s). Currently, in o11s, every mesh node is associated with a maximum of one mesh gate. This type of single association directs the entire traffic from a node towards the mesh gate it is associated with. The gate's available bandwidth is shared by all its clients (nodes), and consequently, the throughput per client is reduced with an increase in the number of clients. Additionally, the mesh gate being common to many outbound paths, experiences a reduction in it’s effective link capacity due to the multipoint-to-point nature of the associations. By enabling multipoint-to-multipoint associations, this paper aims to improve the utilization of total available bandwidth by using multiple Internet access gateways inside a Wireless Mesh Network. This is achieved in a transparent manner without requiring any changes to applications. The overall load on the network is balanced across multiple gateways by using a traffic sensitive approach for gateway selection. Conventionally, in wireless networks, associating with multiple gateways requires multiple wireless NICs. Our approach moves away from this convention and uses a single wireless NIC to associate with multiple internet gateways, thereby reducing hardware costs.

INTRODUCTION

Wirless Mesh Networks have seen tremendous growth in the recent years owing to its cost effectiveness due to reduced dependency on wired access networks. The emergence of community mesh, city wide mesh and rural deployments have defined the benefits of Wireless Mesh Networks over the existing wired and other 802.11 based networks. The self-healing and self-organising ability together with the range extension feature makes WMNs have superseded the conventional ad-hoc networks.
 A typical WMN combines a fixed network (backbone) and a mobile network (backhaul). For each WMN, there are mesh stations that implement the mesh facility acting as routers, forwarding traffic to or from other mesh nodes, or providing localised connectivity to stations(STA), devices that contain an IEEE 802.11-conformant medium access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) interface to the wireless medium (WM). Some of these routers, called mesh gates are directly connected to the outside network provide access to one or more distribution systems, via the wireless medium for the mesh basic service set (MBSS).
 Open80211s is an open-source implementation of the recently ratified IEEE 802.11s wireless mesh standard. Open80211s became a part of the linux kernel (release 2.6.26) to realize bringing the wireless mesh network on commodity hardware supported by the kernel. It enabled create the first open implementation of 802.11s in order to consolidate the numerous non-interoperable mesh protocols into one that is based on a standard specification (IEEE 802.11s).
 802.11s based networks use the Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol (HWMP) for L2 routing based on MAC addresses. HWMP provides both proactive path selection and reactive path selection. A mesh station that needs to transmit a frame to an unknown destination can dynamically discover the best path to this destination. Mesh stations can also proactively discover the MBSS and determine best paths to any point of the mesh cloud before needing to send any data frame. 
 In order to connect to the outside network, the mesh nodes and the stations in the WMNs form layer 3 networks by forming an association with the gateway present in the network. Traditionally the mesh nodes can only be associated with one of the available gateways. This type of single association directs the entire traffic from a node towards the mesh gate it is associated with. The gate's available bandwidth is shared by all its clients (nodes), and consequently, the throughput per client is reduced with an increase in the number of clients. Additionally, the mesh gate being common to many outbound paths, experiences a reduction in it’s effective link capacity due to the multipoint-to-point nature of the associations.
 WMNs are self-healing and self-forming networks. But the Layer 3 associations in which the mesh nodes are bound to only one gateway prevents from taking advantage of this facitity offered by the Layer 2 networks. This means that on failure of a mesh gate, the traffic flowing to the gateway through that mesh gate is dropped instead of being re-routed to any other gateway which can be reachable using the L2 network. 
 In order to overcome these shortcomings, this paper suggests an approach to effectively use the capabilties of 802.11s based wireless mesh networks to improve the utilization of total available bandwidth by using multiple Internet access gateways inside a Wireless Mesh Network. By enabling multipoint-to-multipoint association the overall load on the network is balanced across multiple gateways by using a traffic sensitive approach for gateway selection. The method routes the traffic on flow basis in order to maintain the integrity of the flow and avoid the overhead involved in reassembling the packets in case of TCP based traffic. The suggested approach also moves away from the convention of using multiple radios for throughput enhancement and uses a single wireless NIC to associate with multiple internet gateways, thereby reducing hardware costs.

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
Reference [] presents a survey of wireless mesh networks, it discusses some challenges that need to overcome to leverage the benefits of this technology. It states that to ensure reliable mesh connectivity, network self-organization and topology control algorithms are needed. Most applications of WMNs are broadband services with heterogeneous QoS requirements thus, in addition to end-to-end transmission delay and fairness, more performance metrics, such as delay jitter, aggregate and per-node through-put, and packet loss ratios, must be considered by communication protocols. 

Implementation of Wireless Mesh Networks in the Linux kernel is open80211s. As per the 
implementation, every mesh client is associated with one mesh gate. Hence, all the traffic originating from a particular mesh client is served by the associated mesh gate.  Since all traffic is directed towards the gateway and the gateway has a fixed bandwidth that has to be shared by all its clients, the throughput per client is reduced as the number of client nodes increases. The mesh gate being common to many outbound paths reduce the effective link capacity due to the multipoint-to-point nature of the traffic. In addition, if a mesh gate goes down, all the associated clients lose internet connectivity. As Wireless Mesh Networks are self-healing and self-configuring, there should be a mechanism that will automatically try to associate with other mesh gates available on the network. []

[] approach of using multiple gateways needs multiple radios. Every radio is associated one gateway. Hence, multiple gateways are used by routing different flows of traffic through different gateways. This results in increased hardware cost.

[] use RANN frames in order to get all the gateways present in the Mesh Network. RANN frames can be captured only when we are running in monitor mode as they are layer 2 frames. This leads to receiving lot of traffic from the network. Also, all the frames need to be inspected to filter out the RANN frames. This wastes lot of processing power. The gateway selection process select one default gateway. All the traffic is routed via that gateway. When the default gateway is overloaded then it sends a Change_Pkt request to one of the associated node. The node then selects another gateway as its default gateway which in effect uses a single gateway. 

[] paper discusses optimization of bittorent traffic in Wireless Mesh Networks. This approach uses a central server which communicates with the Bittorrent tracker. Also, there dedicated WMN agents which communicate with the server which in turn communicates with the tracker. This results in an unnecessary overhead and increased costs of maintaining a server.
