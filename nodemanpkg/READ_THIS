The configure.ac file has the package name 'nodemanpkg'.
We can write elements as .cc and .hh files and put them in the src folder. 
Those elements would be available in our click files once we 'require' them in the click config file.
To use the package, in a click config file we'll write: require(package "nodemanpkg");

To install the package:
1. run autoconf
2. run ./configure --prefix=DIR
	where DIR is where your click is installed
3. run make install

Whenever you add/remove an element, run make elemlist and then run make install.

Whenever you make changes to an element, just run make install.
